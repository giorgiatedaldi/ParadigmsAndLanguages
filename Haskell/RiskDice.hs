-- Each of two players (attacker A and defender D) rolls three dice
-- Dice are compared in couples
    -- A's highest die against D's highest die... and so on
    -- In case of equal values, D's die wins
-- Repeat the game N times and create a list of N integer results
-- A wins with 3 dice... or 2, 1, 0
-- Optionally, also count the occurrences of each possible result (0-3)


-- Possibly, solve with mapping, filtering, folding, partial applicationâ€¦

-- Possibly, generalize with respect to the number of dice each player rolls (other than three).
